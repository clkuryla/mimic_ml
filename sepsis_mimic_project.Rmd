## Statistical Summaries of Variables

```{r}

# Statistical analysis steps
# Normally distributed continuous variables were
# summarized as the mean ± SD
# Continuous variables of normal distribution were tested by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
# Non-normally distributed continuous variables were summarized as the median
# Student’s t test, One-way ANOVA, Mann–Whitney U or Kruskal–Wallis H test were used to compare continuous data of non-normally distribution, if appropriate.
# Categorical variables were expressed as numbers or percentage and assessed using Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test according to different sample sizes as proper
# Fisher’s uses smaller sample sizes: 20 or 30?

## Three Predictive Models

### Conventional Logistic Regression Model

```{r}

# conducted using these significant variables identified by backward stepwise analysis with Chi-square test. Then we chose an entry probability of < 0.05 by the stepwise selection method

```

#### Table 2
Features selected in the conventional logistic regression 

```{r}

```

### SAPS-II Score Model

```{r}

# we used these time-stamp variables to do prediction based on the methods provided by the original literature of SAPS II [16]

```

### XGBoost Algorithm Model

```{r}

# performed XGBoost model [17, 18] to analysis the contribution (gain) of each variable to 30-days mortality
# at the same time, backward stepwise analysis was processed to select the variable with a threshold of p < 0.05 according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [19]
# After identifying the variables through XGBoost, we used these clinical and laboratory variables included to construct the XGBoost algorithm model

# Data Preparation

# We will start with data_numeric, and adjust as necessary

# Exclude non-predictive columns like IDs, timestamps, or any that are known after outcome.

                       "suspected_infection_time_poe", "antibiotic_time_poe", "blood_culture_time",
                       "hospital_expire_flag", # If they died in the hospital, they died within 30 days, so this doesn't make sense to include
                       "subject_id", "icustay_id", "hadm_id")

# Exclude redundant variables that used to be factors or are not appropriate for this analysis
exclude_cols <- c("gender", # This has already been one hot encoded to is_male 1/0
                  "ethnicity", # has also been one hot encoded

                  "specimen_poe" # has 35 levels but also not one hot encoded
                  )

# Remove columns
model_data <- data_numeric %>%
  select(-all_of(exclude_cols)) %>% 
  select(-all_of(nonpredictor_cols))

# XGBoost Model for Feature Importance

## Model Comparison

### ROC/AUC and DCA

```{r}

# Tested and compared the performances of the three predictive models by area under curves (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and decision curve analysis (DCA), then selected the model that achieved the highest overall diagnostic value for further verification

### Nomogram and Clinical Impact Curve (CIC) 

```{r}
# At last, nomogram and clinical impact curve (CIC) were plotted to evaluate the clinical usefulness and applicability net benefits of the model with the best diagnostic value
